<br>Light feet, big movements
<br>Amazing physicality
<br>Fascinating fun
<br>Children’s honest laughter
<br>A jumble of sale of clothes
<br>Tweed to the tempo
<br>Sprightly sparkles
<br>Rainbow rhythms
<br>Fulfilled by ingenuity
<br>Leaving the studio
<br>Drunk on creativity
<br>’Happy Hour’ smiles
