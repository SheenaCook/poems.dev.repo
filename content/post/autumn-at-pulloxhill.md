<br>Pumpkin transformed to a mushy blob,
<br>On completion of it’s fearsome job.
<br>Cosmos sentinel below a tree.
<br>White flowers natural purity.
<br>Silent kite floats suspended high.
<br>In the grey stillness of the sky.
<br>Raking, spreading compost around.
<br>Robin brazen on the ground.
<br>
<br>Then school noises rise,
<br>Lunchtime’s whoops and cries.
<br>Watch more leaves flutter down.
<br>Only warrant a momentary frown.
<br>Empty mugs perched on the wall.
<br>Gratefully we’d emptied them all.
<br>Gardeners’ work a manual story.
<br>Lulling the garden into slumbering glory.
<br>Autumn unfolds before it fades.
<br>Spectacular colours and muted shades.
<br>A tranquil scene to slow your gaze,
<br>Knowing Spring is due to amaze.
