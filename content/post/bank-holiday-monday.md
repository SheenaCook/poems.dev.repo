<br>The day was grey
<br>I ran and it was windy
<br>Then we headed out to walk
<br>And we talked
<br>The green corn swished
<br>Cows and horse grazed
<br>A hawk hovered
<br>Nothing much was bothered
<br>In our passing by
<br>Still the clouds covered the sky.
<br>
<br>Sitting in a pub with pale ale
<br>A tin mug of pork scratchings
<br>An excited couple from London
<br>Visitors keen to chat
<br>This and that
<br>The beer, the building
<br>Next an elaborate woman in red
<br>Sat with a man sho spoke on his phone
<br>Of grouting tiles, smoking Sterling King Size
<br>She ate giant marshmallows
<br>Drank coffee and her name was Debbie.
<br>
<br>Walking back we passed ramblers
<br>The fields pretty with flowers
<br>Dismiss the discarded dog poo bags
<br>A dead rat along the way
<br>The hedgerows grown tall
<br>A decade of passing this way
<br>Happy it wasnâ€™t a rainy Bank Holiday.
