<br>Breakfast and banter
<br>Who's the ranter?
<br>Eggs Benedict
<br>Diet not strict?
<br>
<br>Stop talking about dead mice
<br>It's really not nice
<br>Stories of road kill
<br>A tale to thrill!
<br>
<br>Definetely right
<br>To be dining room polite
<br>Watch what you say
<br>During the communal start to the day.
