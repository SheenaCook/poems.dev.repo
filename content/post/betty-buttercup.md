There is a reason and story behind this but it is disguised here in a tale. One of those that is as old as time I am sure.<br>
<br>
<br>Barely Bitter Betty Buttercup
<br>Sent to work for Farmer Barleymow
<br>Her mother made a show.
<br>Betty was earning a honest day’s pay.
<br>Back when she didn’t have much to say.
<br>
<br>The farmer’s first wife died of consumption.
<br>In hindsight locals had a presumption;
<br>Barleymow’s eagerness to produce an heir.
<br>Earned Betty many a misguided stare.
<br>She worked hard, hands coarse and raw.
<br>Milking cows and scattering straw.
<br>
<br>Seasons came and went.
<br>Only an inkling of her mother’s intent.
<br>Farmer Barleymow now modestly wealthy.
<br>A bank balance increasingly healthy.
<br>Took on an eager young housekeeper.
<br>The confident dimpled Daisy Heaper.
<br>
<br>After regular tumbles in the hay shed,
<br>Soon the farmer and Daisy were wed.
<br>Betty’s mother called her a hesitant fool.
<br>Glad to leave, Betty got a job in the local school.
<br>
<br>She met Bertie Buttercup who did the milk round.
<br>A loveable bloke calm and sound.
<br>Like other families in their street.
<br>They sometimes struggled to make ends meet.
<br>Whereas Daisy inherited farm and land.
<br>Locally she had the upper hand.
<br>
<br>Betty learned contentment keeps a family strong,
<br>Her sons did more right than wrong.
<br>Bert and her tend the garden, walk the dog.
<br>Life’s no longer a daily slog.
<br>
<br>Local rumours are bandied about.
<br>Of Barleymow family fallings out.
<br>Daisy bit off more than she could chew.
<br>And Betty now knew.
<br>She need rarely be barely bitter Betty Buttercup.
