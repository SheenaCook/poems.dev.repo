<br>Avoided, unsightly
<br>Fearsome thorns that tear.
<br>Stop and consider.
<br>Listen to birdsong
<br>Heralding security within.
<br>An insectivorous city
<br>Retreat for modest mammals.
<br>Gallery of the spiderâ€™s webs,
<br>Enhanced by crystal dew.
<br>Pastel papery flowers.
<br>Nectar gatherers buzz,
<br>or flutter on elegant wings.
<br>A thriving natural community.
<br>Self sufficient relinquisher
<br>of black pearled berries.
<br>We will gratefully share.
<br>Appreciate that blackberry thicket
<br>For just being there.
