<br>Cancelled Wedding Day
<br>Sorry it was your special day
<br>Only when a reminder pinged did I say
<br>”Oh it was supposed to be Charlotte and Danielle’s wedding day”
<br>This year’s plan has gone
<br>But hey ho the sun shone
<br>I’ve planted seeds
<br>And pulled up weeds
<br>Didn’t get to put on my gladrags
<br>Dance away from handbags
<br>Hopefully you feel no resentment
<br>Rather blessed with happiness and contentment
