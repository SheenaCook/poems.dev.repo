<br>A steadiness as that river flows
<br>Tree colours natural heraldry
<br>Swimming swagger of trout
<br>River festival of ducks, geese, gulls
<br>The sky a blue canvas
<br>Clouds roil in a temporary grey
<br>Cattle graze a placid Autumn
<br>And we walk through it
<br>Feeling gratitude for the grandeur
