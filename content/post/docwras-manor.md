<br>Following the paths meander
<br>Carpets of snowdrops nod
<br>To their fellow hellebores
<br>Shy crocuses, cheery aconites
<br>Euphorbias delighted backdrop
<br>
<br>Proud orchard trees impress
<br>A solitary medlar on abranch
<br>Sinous trees reach out
<br>Mulberry wisely signifies nature
<br>Invokes our faith in nature too
<br>
<br>Mediterranean courtyard on a February day
<br>Grateful to be the sole visitors
<br>Time for reflection and introspection
<br>Looking at the details everywhere
<br>Honesty amongst the pots, the beds and barns
<br>
<br>Greenhouse a haven of warmth
<br>Inhale the comnforting scents
<br>Succulents the hidden hermits
<br>AS geraniums slumber in terracotta
<br>Propagation and hibernations lair
<br>
<br>The gardens gently nurtured
<br>Self seeding encouraged; an informality
<br>Blooms the bountiful gifts
<br>That walls last to embrace
<br>And protect so much beauty within
<br>
<br>The Ravens who created here
<br>Were insihgtful and reflective
<br>Along with their loyal gardeners
<br>There is honour in what is shared
<br>Attuned to horticultural heraldry
<br><br>
