<br>A canoe on a river
<br>We’re the ballast
<br>Easy motion
<br>Paddles slice water
<br>Pewter translucence
<br>Rocks soft yellow green
<br>Weeds tendril stream
<br>We proceed with rhythm:by
<br>Swans indifferently serene
<br>Kingfisher’s electric flash
<br>Reflective purling stretches
<br>Momentarily hastens progress
<br>Towards Symonds Yat
<br>And with regret we leave
<br>A river's, sinous steady grace.
