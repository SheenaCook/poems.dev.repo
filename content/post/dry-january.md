<br>Why try?
<br>Why try to be dry?
<br>What might occur?
<br>A social slur
<br>Whining for wine
<br>A vodkaless void
<br>All things fizzy
<br>Make you dizzy
<br>Don’t really care for alcopops
<br>Always taste of sugary slops
<br>Avoid ruthless piratical rum
<br>No making merry with sherry
<br>Life feels queer
<br>Without beer
<br>Whistfully wishing for whisky
<br>Gin a major sin
<br>Acting with glee
<br>Faced with herbal tea
<br>Fortified by water
<br>Filling us with cheer
<br>The challenge of staying clear
<br>Of any percentage proof
<br>Might make us appear
<br>Sensible and aloof
<br>Please don’t judge
<br>When we try
<br>To get through January dry
