<br>It seems only fair
<br>To tell someone they look like someone else
<br>If you think they do
<br>Why?
<br>Well because it could alter your perspective
<br>You just might treat them differently
<br>Sub consciously imagining
<br>Traces of that other being inhabiting their very essence
<br>It might not occur to them
<br>Or will it?
<br>That is the reason your are telling them
<br>They could be flattered
<br>Confused or down right irritated
<br>Always depends on how they think
<br>And they will think like the individual they are
<br>Rest assured they wonâ€™t be who you want them to be
<br>But hopefully they are just who they are
<br>And looks aside
<br>You embrace them in their entirety
