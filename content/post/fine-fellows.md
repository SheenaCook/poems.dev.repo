<br>Ground frost
<br>Makes digging slow
<br>Robin watches as I go
<br>
<br>Beady eyes
<br>Bare branch vantage
<br>Uncovered habitat advantage
<br>
<br>Flutters to earth
<br>Feeds in the wake
<br>Of spades thunk and quake
<br>
<br>Bold observer
<br>Jauntily tilted head
<br>Gratefully well fed
<br>
<br>Gardener's friends
<br>In winterâ€™s fading light
<br>Robins brings us bright
