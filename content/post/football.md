<br>If ifs and ands were.....
<br>The actions that caused a stir
<br>
<br>Out on the green it ain't bowls
<br>A pitch is for scoring goals
<br>Place your bet
<br>For several in the net
<br>Chants and cheers
<br>Derision loud and angry jeers.
<br>
<br>Come on give it a rest
<br>The players did their best
<br>Rerun chatter, banter abounds
<br>As the folks leave the grounds
<br>Always a mission
<br>To move to the next division.
