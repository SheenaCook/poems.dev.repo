<br>Let’s put a spin on the merits of gin
<br>Seemingly bananas won’t make you thin
<br>A ‘slimmers’ delight, tonic and gin
<br>If you’re an athlete set to win
<br>Not after a night sobbing into gin
<br>Victorian palaces rife with sin
<br>Never, ever throw gin in the bin
<br>Alcohol with berries thrown in
<br>Hey I’m referrin
<br>To head spin, give us more gin
