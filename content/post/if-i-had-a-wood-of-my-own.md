<br>I would.......
<br>Plant my oak saplings
<br>Wildwood edge it
<br>Native trees
<br>Flowers for bees
<br>Green tunnel to lead you in
<br>With reclaimed stone
<br>Build a folly
<br>Mystic and mossy
<br>
<br>Create a dewpond
<br>In a clearing
<br>Where wild animals roam
<br>Wish for a 'Wood Wide Web'
<br>Of fungi to spread
<br>Long for birds
<br>To sculpt their nests
<br>An area to coppice
<br>A place to rest
<br>
<br>Stand a Green Man there
<br>Alive with dappled light
<br>Symbolising the wisdom
<br>Of a holistic woodland idyll
