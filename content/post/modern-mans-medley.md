<br>I was tired of looking shady, my hair was too long
<br>Like a dislillusioned hippy with a favourite bong
<br>So while I lay there sleepin’, I had a dream in my head
<br>I was on the front page of a paper I’d recently read
<br>"f you hear this man singing, quickly exit the train
<br>If you’re not into yoga, if you have half a brain
<br>If you like making love at midnight after a game of Runescape
<br>Then no amount of cocktails will help you escape”
<br>I no longer felt shady, I felt renewed and rather keen
<br>But surfin and jet skiing ain’t part of my normal routine
<br>So I reinvented myself to look like a younger lad
<br>I’m not really a rapper but wrote something not bad
<br>Yes, I like playing Peggy and singing on the train
<br>I’m not much into health food, I am into champagne
<br>I’ve go to groove it out until tomorrow and create a soundscape
<br>At a bar on the high street we’ll plan our escape
<br>So I waited with high hopes and she walked in the place
<br>I knew her smile in an instant, the teeth with a brace
<br>It was a strangely blue lady and she said “Oh it’s you?”
<br>Then I laughed and said ”I am one of the special few
<br>That you liked fruit cider and shaggin on the train
<br>And the feel of locomotion and the taste of champagne
<br>If you like making love at midnight dressed in a Batman cape
<br>You’re the lady I’m looking for, come with me and escape
<br>If you like penises, cicadas and getting wet in the rain
<br>If you’re not into yoga, if you have half a brain
<br>If you like making love at midnight in a pile of red tape
<br>I’m the guy that’s reminding you of Severus Snape
<br>Yes I like plum cobblers and dancing myself insane
<br>I’m not much into health food, I am into champagne
<br>I’m so very handsome onlookers often gape
<br>At a bar in the high street there’ll be no escape.”
