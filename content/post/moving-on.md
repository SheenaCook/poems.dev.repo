<br>His belongings sat in the hall
<br>Close to the door
<br>Everything fitted snugly into his boxes
<br>Expensive black and chrome gear
<br>Up to date PC and state of the art sculpture
<br>His coffee grinder and her toaster
<br>
<br>Her belongings strewn around the bedroom
<br>Some in boxes, some in bags
<br>Bits and pieces, memories he’d called junk
<br>Things they’d collected on the beach
<br>Heaps of clothes bought to impress
<br>Slowly wrapping mugs in paper
<br>She stared at a crossword he’d completed
<br>The cat softly rubbed against her leg
<br>Her cat now, she started to cry
<br>With a tea towel she dried her face
<br>And carefully avoided a swollen black eye
