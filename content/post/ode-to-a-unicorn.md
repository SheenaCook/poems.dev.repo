<br>We never knew your true name
<br>Just used you for a pool game
<br>When Martin ripped your insides out
<br>The young Watsons let out a shout
<br>Once proud and hugely inflated
<br>Now askew and flaccidly deflated
<br>Sheena will carry you gently away
<br>To the municipal bin area today
<br>No glittery spellbinding protection
<br>Enabling plastic fantasy unicorn resurrection
