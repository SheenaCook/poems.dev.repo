<br>Spilling out onto the street
<br>Hidden behind in shadow
<br>Better for a gaggle
<br>Clubbers playing it over
<br>Underworld, hands in the air
<br>Through your head
<br>Loved up, hyped up
<br>Not ready for yer bed
<br>Keep talking
<br>"Who’s walking?”
<br>Watch the sunrise
<br>From Arthur’s Seat
<br>A shove, a push, a gentle nudge
<br>Lounging on the hillside
<br>Drying sweat
<br>Disparate dialogue
<br>Chat, chat, chat
<br>Enough being clever
<br>Enough of that
<br>Stretch out, lie back
<br>Up ’til dawn
<br>The light greets us
<br>And weariness sweeps us
<br>Down the slope
<br>Friendly green kaleidoscope
<br>”Ye off home”
<br>”Aye great night”
<br>”See yas all”
<br>Parting of the ways
<br>Smiles, waves, smiles
<br>Sunrise across the miles.
