<br>Bright dawn
<br>A silent sentinel
<br>On a gate post
<br>Staring perfection
<br>Bringer of truth
<br>Open my eyes
<br>To natureâ€™s calm
<br>You rise transient
<br>Fly shafts of light
<br>And gone.
<br>
<br>Two years on
<br>Spiritual stare
<br>I question why
<br>Maybe always there
<br>At peace, serene
<br>Wildly wise.
