<br>Phalluses appear everywhere
<br>As if conjured from thin air
<br>Knobbly penis shaped potatoes
<br>A cucumber lying between tomatoes
<br>Children’s drawing. What’s that supposed to be?
<br>Not that wee fellow designed to go pee pee
<br>Graffiti overzealously crude
<br>Snowfield defiled to shock a rambling prude
<br>So next time you find yourself suffering from a shock
<br>When some advertising symbol resembles a large cock
<br>Realise you won’t be alone
<br>In thinking that’s not a bone!
