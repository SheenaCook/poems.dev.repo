description: "Chatting nonsense by the pool side with a friend. He once played King Arthur in a Gang Show. His father is a renowned archaeologist and he was oddly familiar with the celebrities that were cruising the shores of Ibiza. My concern was that unless the biscuits were stored in the fridge they fell prey to ants.Maybe poolside he realised an ambition and has since starred in Spanish films."

<br>A new quest created in jest
<br>As once he was King Arthur
<br>And has a famous father
<br>Sorry Finlay found fault 
<br>With facts about flamingoes and salt
<br>Of course there's nothing wrong
<br>Conversing with those who choose a thong
<br>In an exclusive beach bar
<br>Wearing designer trunks, be a star
<br>If all else fails follow the rainbow bridge
<br>Noting biscuits should be stored in the fridge
