<br>A day after persistent rain.
<br>Spring sun the garden's gain.
<br>Clearing beds revealing green
<br>Locating plants yet unseen.
<br>
<br>Gladioli bulbs, orange and pink.
<br>I put them where I think,
<br>The path will be their catwalk.
<br>Each bold statement blooming stalk.
<br>
<br>We know the hurt war has cast.
<br>Make it stop! Please let if be the past.
<br>The news breaks our hearts.
<br>Still Spring uplifts and starts.
<br>
<br>Robin opportunistically near,
<br>Reminder of those held dear.
<br>Bumble bees trundle by.
<br>Prelude to Summer's sigh.
<br>
<br>Children's energetic noise vollies wide.
<br>Jubilant now to be outside.
<br>Efficient clip as horses pass.
<br>Chatter of friends en masse.
<br>
<br>Preparation of beds for seeds.
<br>Steadily removing weeds.
<br>When the working day is done.
<br>The hillside bathes in glowing sun.
