<br>Forsooth, perhaps, or strewth.
<br>A glimmer of truth.
<br>Were the words of a witch?
<br>Trigger for a power crazed bitch.
<br>All that nocturnal wandering.
<br>Suggested she was pondering.
<br>Her and the thane’s wrongdoing.
<br>A miasma of guilt brewing.
<br>Rambling about the damned spot.
<br>Menopausal, sweaty and hot.
<br>The misguided onus on ambition.
<br>Resulting in insomnia and contrition.
<br>And there be the truth.
<br>Lady Macbeth just long in the tooth.
