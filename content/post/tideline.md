I sent my friend a linocut card 
<br>
*[Bird Watching by Diana Ashdown.](https://www.greenpebble.co.uk/collections/diana-ashdown/birds)*
<br>And this poem I wrote
<br>
<br>
<br>On a mudflat somewhere
<br>Will be an oystercatcher
<br>Blissfully unaware
<br>Of an onlookerâ€™s envious stare
<br>A bird who life is clearly black and white
<br>Then whether the moon full and bright
<br>Tides will keep on turning
