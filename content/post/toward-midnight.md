<br>The fire dances in the centre
<br>Circled by the painted caravans
<br>Wooden wagons embrace
<br>Voices rise and fall
<br>Sparks flurry before they fall
<br>
<br>She nods to those who notice
<br>Feet treading the dewy grass
<br>Dogs curled beneath steps
<br>Ignore her lantern's glow
<br>Above floors creak and windows glow
<br>
<br>A breeze riffles the flags
<br>The Big Top's only stirring
<br>Owl hoots approval
<br>As the circus prepares to sleep
<br>Strongman snoring; rumbling sleep
<br>
<br>Bareback ballerina's horse
<br>Crops meadow grass
<br>Snowy unicorn white
<br>Solid in the moonlight
<br>Mane shimmers by moonlight
<br>
<br>On the riverbank
<br>She hangs her clothes
<br>Upon outstretched branch
<br>Wades into the amber water
<br>Floats in the flowing water
<br>
<br>Swimming by the swans serene
<br>The river's their stage for grace
<br>Scars tingle a reminder
<br>She accepts her beauty within
<br>Doubt ebbs away, contentment within
<br>
<br>Willows trail the surface
<br>From the shadows she emerges
<br>Stands modestly statuesque
<br>Let's her skin dry naturally
<br>The stars see her naturally
<br>
<br>Drifting back to the fire
<br>She takes her place
<br>Beside the few that dally
<br>This a travelling community
<br>Now her close knit community
<br>
<br>Embers fade with kisses 'Goodnight'
<br>Acts left in the sawdust ring
<br>She strokes the piebald by her tent
<br>Breaths this restful moment
<br>Foresees the next dream moment
