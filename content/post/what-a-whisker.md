<br>When attending a less than exhilarating course
<br>To stay focused requires concentration of superhuman force
<br>My fingers will begin to wander across my facial skin
<br>Inevitably discovering a wiry whisker protruding from my chin
<br>Then my train of thought begins to meander
<br>To colleagues possible comments and slander
<br>”Oh have you seen that bearded woman?”
<br>Never heeding facial depilation is positively subhuman
<br>Trying to pluck it out with stumpy fingernails
<br>Strong and defiant, of course that fails
<br>Why? Why did I not pack a pair of tweezers?
<br>Now convinced I resemble a pubescent geezer
<br>Trying to concentrate on dull lecturer’s designer dress
<br>My aggravation escalating into panic and stress
<br>I’m now convinced I’ve mutated into Winnie the Witch
<br>Perhaps I should accept vanity is never without a hitch
<br>That lady in the lilac chiffon is staring at me
<br>Now I’m praying it’s nearly time to stop for tea
<br>I rest my face upon my hand
<br>Thoughts trickle through my brain like sand
<br>Me before a mirror analysing the offending hair
<br>It with hardy root and bristly glare
<br>
<br>Then I almost speak aloud my exclamation “Oh Heck!”
<br>There is another one coiling from my neck.
