<br>**bam** - someone who is foolish, disruptive, annoying, obnoxious
<br>
<br>**slainte mhath** - (pronounced swan-g-var) cheers
<br>
<br>**dram** - a small drink of whisky
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Aye it’s deemed Scotland’s national drink
<br>Afore you consume stop and think
<br>A wee nightcap before ya bed
<br>Relaxes and slows a busy head
<br>Just one for the road and ya’ll go
<br>Into the night with a cosy glow
<br>
<br>Try not to despise
<br>The advice of the “worldly wise”
<br>Clutching the bottle to your chest
<br>Ignoring what’s for the best
<br>When peer pressure’s stalking
<br>It’ll be the drink doin the talking
<br>
<br>Remember the amber liquid’s charm
<br>Is known to unleash untold harm
<br>Very few are protected from the spell
<br>Casting loved ones inot living hell
<br>Stevenson wrote of Jekyll and Hyde
<br>Perhaps the demonic whisky slide
<br>
<br>A measure to raise a toast
<br>Ne’er suited to excessive boast
<br>The best malts require celebration
<br>Refined and savoured in moderation
<br>Be admired for who you are
<br>Only one generous “Slainte mhath”.
