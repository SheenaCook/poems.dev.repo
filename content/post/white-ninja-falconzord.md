<br>That coveted Christmas present
<br>Parents eager to please, their intent
<br>The wrapping paper cast aside
<br>Wrestled the zord from inside
<br>Impressive box, plastic cocoon
<br>Awe inspiring demonstration soon
<br>Crestfallen the realisation is quick
<br>Appealing to know what’s the trick
<br>The advertising lie
<br>It couldn’t really fly
