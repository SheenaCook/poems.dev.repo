<br>Dark hedgerows where scarlet berries hang
<br>Robins who stop to meet your eye
<br>Flocks of birds soaring high
<br>Pushing the clouds to reveal blue sky
<br>And as you walk many a mile
<br>Remember thereâ€™s been much that made you smile
<br>Two dogs hurtle by
<br>Proven loyalty makes you sigh
<br>A realisation in this open space
<br>Family and friends are yours to embrace
