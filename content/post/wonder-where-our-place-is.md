<br>As I read and toss in my bed
<br>Grey skies fill me with a longing for sun
<br>My mind wanders across the span
<br>Of all of those memories and reasons
<br>For the things I have done
<br>Nothing is more apparent than my slightness
<br>In the whole scheme of the world
<br>Therefore it is with warmth
<br>I cling to the love of those I love
<br>For I know full well there are those
<br>Who have known love at a price
<br>The smallest happenings can bring
<br>The wonder which helps us forget
<br>Hurts and sadness
<br>Let yourself stop to enjoy them
<br>As they can be caught in a suns ray
<br>Only in the passing of time
